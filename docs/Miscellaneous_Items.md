# Miscellaneous Items

Just some random items that don't fit in other sections.

## DNS Hostname

The `craigmiller160.ddns.net` hostname comes from the [NoIP](https://www.noip.com/) service. It can be managed at that link.

## Let's Encrypt TLS

The public TLS cert comes from Let's Encrypt. There is a separate repo with instructions on how to manage this. I'm leaving this section vague because of plans to further integrate Let's Encrypt into this terraform project.
